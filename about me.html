      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p1>My name is Micah Estelle. I am a junior at EWU, this is my first year in the VCD program. I am interested in learning about graphic design because I aspire to be in the advertising industry. I want to be well rounded in my skills and graphic design is one area that I have never really put my emphasis in. I can't say that I have a particular interest in web design beyond it being a requirement for this program however, I am interested to learn about it and excited to see how much information I can soak up in these 10 weeks.</p1>
