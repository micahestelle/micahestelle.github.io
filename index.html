    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a web page.</p>
      <p>This is a webpage that I thought was interesting, I would be interested to know if it could be designed without Java Script</p>
    <a href="http://muvinteractive.com/">Muv Interactive</a>
      <p>Another website I would be interested in learning how to recreate is as follows</p>
    <a href="http://www.gitman.com/">GITMAN</a>
    <p>Something I really like about this site is the simplicity of it. I like the black and white pictures against the white background. I would really like to learn how to integrate pictures into my design.</p>
