    <h3>Another website I would be interested in learning how to recreate is as follows</h3>
    <p>http://www.gitman.com/</p>
    <h4>Something I really like about this site is the simplicity of it. I like the black and white pictures against the white background. I would really like to learn how to integrate pictures into my design.</h4>
